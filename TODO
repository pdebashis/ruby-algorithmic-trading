--- TODO
 - Limit strategy runtime between 9.15 and 15.15
 - Some modification in booking (target case only), book at 10 pts below the mentioned target, eg: if target is at 22300, if we touch 22290 we can book position.
 - Exception handing when APIs are called, eg. ltp quote 
 - if big candle (green,red), then skip the first target and stoploss to be dynamic. (starting from low of big candle)
 - if same color big candle (green,red), target is jumped and stop loss is dynamic.
 - if opposite big candle (green,red) while holding position, close the existing trade. Make a new trade of opposite direction.
 - if data points less than 10 mins, do not form candle
