 - if big candle (green,red), then skip the first target and stoploss to be dynamic. (starting from low of big candle)
 - if same color big candle (green,red), target is jumped and stop loss is dynamic.
 - if opposite big candle (green,red) while holding position, close the existing trade. Make a new trade of opposite direction.
